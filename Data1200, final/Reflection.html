                When making a huge change to your lifestyle, there will be an adjustment period. Whether this is getting a new dog, 
                starting at a new job, or going off to university to study. In most people's lives, their years at university are some of the best years. 
                Filled with new exciting experiences, friends, and knowledge. However, although it might seem like a cakewalk at first glance, it is certainly not.   
                It is also a big process. Transitioning from being a pupil to a student, is one of many trial and errors and finding out what works for you.
                You are now responsible for your own learning, and you are the only one responsible for making sure you understand and learn the curriculum. 
                This is just one of the many differences between high school and university. It might be tough in the beginning, but it gets better. 
                I will therefore provide insight from some of my own experiences about how I adjusted to the different style of learning.

                As mentioned earlier, when you enter university, you are responsible for your own learning. Even though there are people there to help you explain, 
                there is rarely any form of one on one guidance like in high school. Of course, if you need help there are people willing to help, but you will have to send them a mail, 
                and wait for their response. As well as they are not available at all times like it would be in a traditional classroom. But it is not all bad, if you are one of the students
                who understand the topic, it is nice to know that you do not have to go through a topic you understand because someone else does not get it.
                Understanding the topic, and learning the curriculum are very heavily emphasized during your years at university. This will therefore result in there being more pressure 
                on the individual, as opposed to earlier years. By exerting pressure upon the students, there are a lot of people who study who might feel burnt out as 
                they most likely will have to balance work and school. As well as trying to workout in amidst of all of it, there will be next to almost no free time if you got a job, study, and do some
