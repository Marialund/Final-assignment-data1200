                    When making a huge change to your lifestyle, there will be an adjustment period.
                    Whether this is getting a new dog, starting at a new job, or going off to university to study.
                    In most people's lives, their years at university are some of their best years. 
                    Filled with new exciting experiences, friends, and knowledge.
                    However, although it might seem like a cakewalk at first glance, it is certainly not.
                    It is also a big process. Transitioning from being a pupil to a student, is one of 
                    many trial and errors and finding out what works for you.
                    You are now responsible for your own learning, and you are the only 
                    one responsible for making sure you understand and learn the curriculum.
                    This is just one of the many differences between high school and university.
                    It might be tough in the beginning, but it gets better. I will therefore provide insight from 
                    some of my own experiences about how I adjusted to the different style of learning.

            <h2>
                Being a student, rather than a pupil
            </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, when you enter university, you are responsible for your own learning. 
                    Even though there are people there to help you explain,
                    there is rarely any form of one-on-one guidance like in high school.
                    Of course, if you need help there are people willing to help, 
                    but you will have to send them a mail, and wait for their response.
                    As well as they are not available always like it would be in a traditional classroom.
                    But it is not all bad, if you are one of the students who understand the topic, 
                    it is nice to know that you do not have to go
                    through a topic you understand because someone else does not get it. 
                    Understanding the topic, and learning the curriculum are very heavily emphasized
                    during your years at university. 
                    This will therefore result in there being more pressure on the individual,
                    as opposed to earlier years. 
                    By exerting pressure upon the students,
                    there are a lot of people who study who might feel burnt out
                    as they most likely will have to balance work and school.
                    Since the student loan itself does not pay very well.
                    As well as trying to work out in amidst of all of it,
                    there will be next to almost no free time if you got a job, study, and play any kind of sports at all. 
                    This is a huge difference, as in high school,
                    you could get away with working on some days, working out on others, and still have some free time.
                    There are those students, who just go out often and does not attend class.
                    But this does not apply to them, 
                    because there is a difference between choosing to "feel stressed out" and being stressed out.

                    In conclusion, there are a lot of differences when entering university.
                    Even though it might be a challenge adjusting at first,
                    it gets fairly easy and I honestly prefer the student lifestyle over the pupil lifestyle.
                    As it gives you freedom to choose when you want to work with school,
                    and as long as you stay consistent, and remain fairly active in class you should be able to pass the subject.
                    Even though there is a lot of pressure upon the individual when studying, 
                    it is necessary to keep the students focused,
                    and remembering that school is still as important as their other responsibilities.
                    It is especially important to have your priorities straight when the exams roll around,
                    as people tend to not get enough time to study for the final exam because they would rather do something else.
                    I can say that the student lifestyle is one that teaches you self-discipline,
                    and I ensure you that you will learn a lot about your own character during this period.
                    There are multiple screenshots below some of the code I have learned during my stay at
                    university so far.
