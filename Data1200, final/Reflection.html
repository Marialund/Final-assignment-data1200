                        When making a huge change to your lifestyle, there will be an adjustment period.
                        Whether this is getting a new dog, starting at a new job, or going off to university to study.
                        In most people's lives, their years at university are some of their best years. 
                        Filled with new exciting experiences, friends, and knowledge.
                        However, although it might seem like a cakewalk at first glance, it is certainly not.
                        It is also a big process. 
                        You are now responsible for your own learning, and you are the only 
                        one responsible for making sure you understand and learn the curriculum.
                        This is just one of the many differences between high school and university.
                        It might be tough in the beginning, but it gets better. I will therefore provide insight from 
                        some of my own experiences about how I adjusted to the different style of learning.

                    Being a student, rather than a pupil
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        You are now responsible for your own learning. 
                        Even though there are people there to help you explain,
                        there is rarely any form of one-on-one guidance like in high school.
                        As well as they are not available always like it would be in a traditional classroom.
                        But it is not all bad, if you understand the topic, 
                        you do not have to go through it again, because someone else does not get it. 
                        Understanding the topic, and learning the curriculum are very heavily emphasized
                        during your years at university. 
                        This will therefore result in there being more pressure on the individual,
                        as opposed to earlier years. 
                        There are a lot of people who study who might feel burnt out
                        as they most likely will have to balance work and school.
                        As well as trying to work out in amidst of all of it,
                        there will be next to almost no free time if you got a job, study, and play any kind of sports at all.

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, there are a lot of differences when entering university.
                        As in high school,
                        you could get away with working on some days, working out on others, and still have some free time.
                        Even though it might be a challenge adjusting at first,
                        it gets fairly easy and I honestly prefer the student lifestyle over the pupil lifestyle.
                        As it gives you freedom to choose when you want to work with school,
                        and as long as you stay consistent, and remain fairly active in class you should be able to pass the subject.
                        Even though there is a lot of pressure upon the individual when studying, 
                        it is necessary to keep the students focused,
                        and remembering that school is still as important as their other responsibilities.
                        It is especially important to have your priorities straight when the exams roll around,
                        as people tend to not get enough time to study for the final exam because they would rather do something else.
                        I can say that the student lifestyle is one that teaches you self-discipline,
                        and I ensure you that you will learn a lot about your own character during this period.
