    <h2>Technology as an integral part of neo-authoritarian societies</h2>
  </header>

<div class = "flex-container"> 
    <div class = "text-1">
      <p> As the position of democracy in the world is gradually becoming weaker, the rise of authoritarianism is looking imminent in 
        a number of nations. Being technology developers, it is important that an understanding of how our technology can be misused
        is established. For instance, in China, the "social credit system" is being developed and gradually integrated into the daily lives 
        of millions. The same technology has potential in other authoritarian states, but also in strong democratic nations.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "text-2">
      
      <p> An example of the potential the social credit system has in the West can be found in London, where CCTV and surveillance is 
          already omnipresent to a point where not being continually observed by technology is nearing impossible. Should England enter a crisis
        prompting the politicians to justify the implementation of a system similar to China's social credit system, Londoners and 
        Englishmen in general will find themselves in a precarious situation where the state's surveillance abilities are encompassing 
        enough to gain complete control over its population.

    <div class = "text-3">
      <p> Understanding the ways in which technology is integrated into the very fabric of modern society allow developers to comprehend 
          their work's potential for damage. </p>
