    <h1>Technology as an integral part of neo-authoritarianism</h1>
    <p>As the position of democracy in the world is gradually becoming weaker, the rise of authoritarianism is looking imminent in 
        a number of nations. As technology developers, it is important that an understanding of how our technology can be misused
        is established. In China, the "social credit system" is being developed and gradually integrated into the daily lives of millions. 
        The same technology has potential in other authoritarian states, but also in strong democratic nations. 
    </p>
    <p> An example of the potential the social credit system has in the West can be found in London, where CCTV and surveillance is already
        omnipresent to a point where not being continually observed by technology is nearing impossible. Should England enter a crisis
        prompting the politicians to justify the implementation of a system similar to China's social credit system, Londoners and 
        Englishmen in general will find themselves in a precarious situation where the state's surveillance abilities are encompassing enough to gain
        complete control over its population.
