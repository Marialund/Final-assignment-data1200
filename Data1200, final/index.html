                <bold>This is a general information page that should give you an idea about what this wholde site is about, -our experience 
                as first year students here at OsloMet. Our accessibility page contains an essay including some reflection about the challenges 
                we've experienced in our transition into the university life.
                We love being first year students. bla bla bla! It is the best thing ever and so much fun, we just can't belive it.
                There is literally no other place we would rather be right now. </bold>
