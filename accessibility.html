      Accessibility and universal design have become pillars of modern website design. As web designers, 
      it is our duty to ensure that <b>our work is for everyone</b>. You may read about the considerations and choices 
      we have made in regards to accessibility, universal design, and responsiveness in the articles below.

      <h2>
        Responsive design
      </h2>
      <p>
        Flex-boxes have been actively used due to the dualistic consideration of easily maintainable code and responsive design. 
        The way we have used flex-boxes facilitates both considerations. 
        As all screen sizes are accommodated for on our website, it becomes accessible for a larger number of people. 
        For instance, most internet traffic in third-world areas is derived from mobile devices, as they are cheaper, 
        mobile, and can be used between power outages.

      <h2>Universal design</h2>
      <p> 
          <b>Visual impairment:</b>
        <br> 
          Color contrast is a simple yet largely important visual element that ensures readability and ease of the eye. 
          For our website, we chose a simple background with high-contrasting text color. The front page was given a background 
          image to increase the visual profile, however we changed the opacity down to 30% with a black background color to create 
          contrasting colours. Most people with visual impairments have a screen reader for their computer. 
          Thus, we customized the code in this regard. In the HTML-files, we made sure to use “bold” tags in order for 
          the screen reader to put emphasis on certain parts of the text. Finally, we provided the pictures with alt-tags 
          to achieve accessibility in case of blindness, poor internet-speeds, or back-end errors.
         
        <br><br> 
          <b>Auditory impairment:</b>
        <br>
          We had no videos or other audio elements on the sites. If included, such items would have been captioned 
          and texted. 
        <br><br> 
          <b>Mobility impairment:</b>
        <br>
          By using the scroll-buttons, as well as “tab” and “enter” the user may maneuver through our sites and access links. 
          The navigation is simple and intuitive, and accessibility is increased due to the large, clickable buttons
        <br><br> 
          <b>Cognitive impairment and Vestibular disorders and seizures:</b>
        <br>
          Cognitive impairments require the webdesign to be simple as to allow focus on specific content. 
          Content such as sub-headers and important sentences should be emphasized through proper semantic tags in order to 
          draw attention to them. By making our layout minimalistic and largely consistent, we have managed to create an 
          online environment void of unnecessary distractions, facilitating use for people with cognitive impairments. 
          These considerations also benefit people with vestibular disorders and seizures, as the page does not contain 
          features known to trigger symptoms of such disorders.
